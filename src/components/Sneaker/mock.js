Similar to the three past executions, the Dunk Low Premium SB 'Purple Lobster' is influenced by strange color specimens discovered in nature due in part to genetic abnormalities that make their exoskeleton appear in distinct colors, such as yellow, blue and purple. Special details include a plaid pattern on the lining, red and white, and an elastic band wrapped around the forefoot comparable to how lobster claws are secured.",
